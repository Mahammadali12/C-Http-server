Below is a structured roadmap that should help you build an HTTP server from scratch, using C as the implementation language. The roadmap is divided into two main sections:

1. *Theoretical Requirements* – what background knowledge and protocols you need to know.  
2. *Programming Roadmap* – the practical, step-by-step plan in C, starting with the simplest HTTP version (HTTP/0.9) and incrementally adding complexity.

---

## 1. Theoretical Requirements

### 1.1. Network Basics
1. *TCP/IP*: Understand how data is routed across the internet, basic networking concepts, and how TCP provides reliable data transfer.
2. *Sockets*: Study how to create, bind, listen on, accept, read from, and write to sockets.
3. *Ports*: Be comfortable with the idea that servers bind to a port to listen for incoming connections (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).

### 1.2. HTTP Protocol Fundamentals
1. *History of HTTP*  
   - *HTTP/0.9*: The original, extremely simple version. Only GET requests, no headers.  
   - *HTTP/1.0*: Introduction of headers, status codes, and more advanced features.  
   - *HTTP/1.1*: Persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, more flexible caching, and many commonly used headers.  
   - *HTTP/2*: Multiplexing, binary framing, more efficient use of TCP connections, etc.  
2. *Structure of an HTTP Exchange*  
   - Request line (e.g., GET /index.html HTTP/1.1)  
   - Headers (e.g., Host:, User-Agent:, etc.)  
   - Body (only for some requests like POST or PUT)  
   - Response (status line, headers, body)  

### 1.3. Operating System Concepts
1. *Processes and Threads*: Different concurrency approaches for handling multiple connections (e.g., multi-process, multi-thread, event-driven, etc.).
2. *File Handling*: How to open, read, and write files, which is necessary to serve static files like HTML, CSS, JS, or images.
3. *Security*: Basics like preventing buffer overflows, handling user input carefully, etc.

### 1.4. Build Environment & Tooling
1. *Compiler Toolchain* (GCC/Clang, Make, or CMake)  
2. *Debugging Tools* (GDB, Valgrind)  
3. *Version Control* (Git) – to track your changes and manage your project

## 2. Programming Roadmap in C

Below is a set of milestones to build your HTTP server from the ground up. The idea is to start with the simplest version of HTTP (0.9) and gradually add functionalities.

### 2.1. Basic Network Skeleton

1. *Create a Socket*  
   - Use the socket() call to create a TCP socket.  
   - Bind it to port 80 (or another test port, e.g., 8080).
2. *Listen and Accept*  
   - Call listen() to wait for incoming connections.  
   - Use accept() in a loop to handle requests one by one.  
   - Print debug messages to confirm connections are established.

*Deliverable*: A tiny program that accepts a connection and prints a message like “New connection established”.

---

### 2.2. Implement HTTP/0.9

HTTP/0.9 is very basic:
- Only GET requests.  
- No headers.  
- The client sends a line like GET /index.html\r\n, and the server returns the file contents.

*Steps*:

1. *Parse the HTTP/0.9 Request*  
   - Read a single line from the client (e.g., GET /something\r\n).  
   - Extract the requested path (e.g., /something).
2. *Open and Read the File*  
   - Map the requested path to a file in your server’s directory (e.g., ./www/something).  
   - Handle the case where the file does not exist: you can send a simple error message, or no content at all (HTTP/0.9 does not define status codes).
3. *Write the File Back to the Client*  
   - Write the raw contents of the file.  
   - Close the connection.

*Deliverable*: A server that, when you open http://localhost:8080/ in a browser, returns the contents of an index.html file from your server’s file system, or some default file if none is found.

---

### 2.3. Transition to HTTP/1.0

Once HTTP/0.9 is working, incrementally upgrade:

1. *Request Parsing*  
   - Parse the request line: GET /index.html HTTP/1.0  
   - Add logic to parse simple headers (e.g., User-Agent:, Host:).  
   - Handle the case of missing or partial headers gracefully.
2. *Response Format*  
   - Introduce the status line: HTTP/1.0 200 OK (or other codes like 404 Not Found).  
   - Add some response headers, like Content-Type and Content-Length.
3. *Close Connection*  
   - HTTP/1.0 typically closes the connection after the request-response cycle, so you can keep that behavior.

*Deliverable*: A minimal HTTP/1.0 server that returns static HTML files. You will now be returning HTTP status lines and headers in addition to the raw file data.

---

### 2.4. HTTP/1.1 Enhancements

HTTP/1.1 adds several features; start with the most important ones:

1. *Persistent Connections*  
   - Implement the Connection: keep-alive header to keep the connection open after sending the response.  
   - Handle multiple requests in a single connection until the client or server decides to close it.
2. *Chunked Transfer Encoding*  
   - This is optional but important for dynamic content. Instead of sending a Content-Length, you can send the data in chunks.  
3. *Host Header Requirement*  
   - HTTP/1.1 requires the Host header.  
   - Parse it, validate it (if needed), and handle virtual hosting if you want to support multiple domains in the future.
4. *Other Status Codes*  
   - Implement 400 (Bad Request), 405 (Method Not Allowed), etc., to handle unexpected conditions better.

*Deliverable*: An HTTP/1.1-compliant server that can handle multiple requests on one connection (keep-alive), parse/return headers, and possibly handle chunked encoding if you choose.

---

### 2.5. Concurrency & Scaling

1. *Multi-Process or Multi-Thread*  
   - Fork a new process for each connection, or spawn a new thread.  
   - A simpler approach is to use a thread pool (a fixed number of threads).
2. *Event-Driven (Optional Advanced)*  
   - Use non-blocking I/O with select(), poll(), or epoll() to handle many connections in a single thread loop.
3. *Resource Management*  
   - Implement timeouts on connections.  
   - Limit maximum concurrent connections to avoid exhaustion of resources.

*Deliverable*: A server that can handle multiple simultaneous requests without blocking each other excessively, whether by forking, threading, or using an event loop.

---

### 2.6. Advanced Features

1. *HTTPS (TLS/SSL)*  
   - Implement SSL/TLS for secure connections. You can use an external library like OpenSSL, mbedTLS, or GnuTLS.  
2. *Logging*  
   - Create structured logs for each request (method, path, status code, bytes sent, etc.).  
3. *Configuration Files & Command-Line Options*  
   - Let the user specify port, document root, concurrency model, etc.  
4. *CGI or Embedded Scripts*  
   - If you want to run server-side programs, you can implement CGI or a simplified module for running external scripts.

---

## 3. Recommended Learning and Practice Flow

1. *Low-Level Socket Programming Exercises*  
   - Practice by building a simple TCP echo server in C.  
   - Then move on to a minimal HTTP/0.9 server that just reads and writes static files.

2. *Parsing Strings and Data*  
   - Write code that splits HTTP request lines into tokens (GET, /path, HTTP/1.1, etc.).  
   - Use a robust approach for reading lines (e.g., fgets, manual buffering) so you don’t lose data or overflow buffers.

3. *Return Correct HTTP Responses*  
   - Hardcode a few known status lines for success, error, etc.  
   - Gradually expand your parser to handle more headers.

4. *Testing Tools*  
   - Use curl -v http://localhost:8080/ to see exactly what your server is returning.  
   - Use a web browser for a friendlier check.  
   - Automate testing with scripts or HTTP testing tools.

5. *Iterate and Improve*  
   - Gradually add concurrency, better error handling, and more advanced HTTP features as you get comfortable.

---

## 4. Conclusion

This roadmap breaks down the journey from learning the basics of networking and sockets in C, through implementing the simplest HTTP/0.9 server, up to more sophisticated concurrency handling and HTTP/1.1 features. By tackling it step by step, you’ll build not only the code but also the conceptual understanding of how HTTP servers work under the hood.

*Key Takeaways*:

- Start small (HTTP/0.9) to build core understanding and confidence.  
- Incrementally add features (HTTP/1.0 then HTTP/1.1).  
- Focus on correctness first, then performance/concurrency.  
- Use the right tools for debugging and testing at each stage.
